## v01.00: just a draft to get approximate sizing on steering wheel
  - didn't account for the logitech circoelcover fiting inside of the stand -> made diameter too small

## v01.01: modular design on steering wheel
  - display could be detatched and re-attached to the base
  - had holes pre-cut so screw could attach to base
  * ended up having to abort this design in the end because the usb cable was intended to go through the middle of 
    the steering column however, the column is too small to fit a usb cable 
    - tried taking about a usb cable to feed through and solder the end back to it but was going to be too difficult
      and the cable would likely break after a while of turning the wheel several hundred degrees

## v01.00: attach to side of chasis
